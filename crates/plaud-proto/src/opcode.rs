//! 16-bit opcode constants for the tinnotech pen-BLE protocol.
//!
//! Every opcode listed here was observed on the wire in at least one
//! captured btsnoop session under
//! [`specs/re/captures/btsnoop/`](../../../specs/re/captures/btsnoop/)
//! and cross-referenced against the SDK builder classes under
//! [`specs/re/apk-notes/3.14.0-620/ble-protocol.md`](../../../specs/re/apk-notes/3.14.0-620/ble-protocol.md).
//!
//! Additional SDK opcodes that we have not yet exercised on the wire
//! are tracked in the backlog at
//! `specs/re/backlog.md` and will land with their typed `encode::*`
//! wrappers in milestone M11.
